## **Bias My Ass: A Browser Extension for Awareness of Author Biases**

**Introduction**

Bias My Ass is a browser extension designed to promote critical thinking and media literacy by highlighting potential biases in the authors you read online. Our extension provides valuable insights into an author's past writings and user reviews, helping you make more informed decisions about the content you consume.

**How it Works**

Our extension uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze an author's previous articles and reviews from our user community. This information is then used to generate a bias score, which is displayed as a subtle notification next to the author's name.

**Features**

* **Author Bias Score**: Get an instant snapshot of an author's potential biases based on their past writings and user reviews.
* **Detailed Author Profile**: Click on the bias score to view a detailed profile of the author, including their writing history and user reviews.
* **User Reviews**: Contribute to the community by leaving reviews of your own, helping to shape the bias scores of your favorite authors.

**Why it Matters**

In today's digital landscape, it's more important than ever to be aware of the biases that shape the information we consume. By using Bias My Ass, you'll be better equipped to:

* Identify potential biases and make more informed decisions about the content you read.
* Engage in more nuanced and thoughtful discussions about the topics that matter most.
* Support authors who share your values and promote diverse perspectives.
